Hunger ist eine absolute Grenzerfahrung. Am Anfang fühlt man sich noch gut: Wenn die Nahrungszufuhr abgeschnitten wird, putscht sich der Körper selbst auf. Adrenalin strömt ins System. Man fühlt sich plötzlich besser, voller Energie. Es ist wohl ein Mechanismus, mit dem der Körper signalisieren will: Ich habe noch Reserven, du kannst sie für die Suche nach Nahrung einsetzen.

The South sells its cotton and sugar to England and Europe, and buys manufactured goods from those places instead of from the industrial North.

From that Time-Life card, I learned the basics about elephants. They were the largest land animals on the planet, sometimes weighing more than six tons. They ate three to four hundred pounds of food each day. They had the longest pregnancy of any land mammal—twenty-two months. They lived in breeding herds, led by a female matriarch, often the oldest member of the group. She was the one who decided where the group went every day, when they took a rest, where they ate, and where they drank. Babies were raised and protected by all the female relatives in the herd, and traveled with them, but when males were about thirteen years old, they left—sometimes preferring to wander on their own and sometimes gathering with other males in a bull group.

I knew that in 1916, in Erwin, Tennessee, an elephant named Mary was tried and hanged for murder.

Because you give someone something one day doesn’t mean you have created the cause to receive exactly the same thing another day. Karma operates not so much as some external credit-and-debit ledger but more as an energy, a charge that grows over time.

But in a society where it’s normal to die of heart disease, having a “normal” cholesterol level is probably not a good thing.

You can slow down this oxidant process by eating foods containing lots of antioxidants. You can tell whether a food is rich in antioxidants by slicing it open, exposing it to air (oxygen), and then seeing what happens. If it turns brown, it’s oxidizing. Think about our two most popular fruits: apples and bananas. They turn brown quickly, which means there aren’t a lot of antioxidants inside them.

The body uses up a lot of energy to maintain its immune system, so why remain on high alert 24-7 when we only eat a few times a day? Why would our bodies specifically use vegetables as the bat signal to assemble the troops? We evolved over millions of years eating mostly weeds—wild plants, including dark-green, leafy vegetables (or, as they were known back then, leaves)—so our bodies may have evolved to equate vegetables with mealtime. Vegetables’ presence in the gut works as a signal to upkeep our immune systems.32 So if we don’t eat plants with each meal, we may be undermining our bodies’ strategy to protect us.

Another reason animal protein may be so detrimental to kidney function is that it is generally more acid forming. This is because animal protein tends to have higher levels of sulfur-containing amino acids, such as methionine, which produce sulfuric acid when metabolized in the body. Fruits and vegetables, on the other hand, are generally base forming, which helps neutralize acids in our kidneys.

If even a single sip of alcohol might produce cancer-causing levels of acetaldehyde in the mouth, what about using mouthwash that contains alcohol? Researchers who tested the effects of a variety of retail mouthwashes and oral rinses concluded that, although the risk is slight, it is probably best to refrain from using such products if they contain alcohol.

Interestingly, drinking only red wine was not associated with breast cancer risk. Why? A compound in red wine appears to suppress the activity of an enzyme called estrogen synthase, which breast tumors can use to create estrogen to fuel their own growth.24 This compound is found in the skin of the dark-purple grapes used to make red wine, which explains why white wine appears to provide no such benefit,25 since it’s produced without the skin. The researchers concluded that red wine may “ameliorate the elevated breast cancer risk associated with alcohol intake.”26 In other words, the grapes in red wine may help cancel out some of the cancer-causing effects of the alcohol. But you can reap the benefits without the risks associated with imbibing alcoholic beverages by simply drinking grape juice or, even better, eating the purple grapes themselves—preferably ones with seeds, as they appear to be most effective at suppressing estrogen synthase.27 It’s good (and delicious) to know that strawberries,28 pomegranates,29 and plain white mushrooms30 may also suppress the potentially cancer-promoting enzyme.

Wenn ich so weit weg von allem bin, stellen sich zwei Gefühle ein: Das eine ist Hilflosigkeit, ist Sorge. Was ist, wenn uns hier etwas passiert? Das andere ist Freiheit, ist Unbekümmertheit. Die stellt sich ein, wenn der Rest der Welt weit genug entfernt ist. Wenn die Distanz groß ist, verliert alles seine Bedeutung, und das befreit. Es gibt nur noch das Hier. Keine Pflichten und vor allem: Keine Alternativen.

Auch wenn es nicht wie in Europa sein Leben lang gequält wurde, bin ich für seinen Tod verantwortlich, nur um mir einen Gaumenschmaus zu gestatten. Aber am meisten stört mich die Quälerei. Massentierhaltung ist unbeschreiblich grausam, aber auch das, was manche Jäger hier mit ihrer Beute anstellen

Leonardo da Vinci, forse l’uomo piú ingegnoso di tutti i tempi, scriveva cosí: Se realmente sei, come ti descrivi, il re degli animali – direi piuttosto re delle bestie, essendo tu stesso la piú grande! – perché non eviti di prenderti i loro figli per soddisfare il tuo palato, per amor del quale ti sei trasformato in una tomba per tutti gli animali? Non produce forse la natura cibi semplici in abbondanza che possano sfamarti? E se non riesci ad accontentarti di tali cibi semplici, non puoi preparare infinite pietanze mescolando tra loro tali cibarie? E ancora: Verrà il tempo in cui l’uomo non dovrà piú uccidere per mangiare, e anche l’uccisione di un solo animale sarà considerata un grave delitto.

Il geniale frullatutto riesce anche a trasformare, per motivi fisici a me misteriosi, della frutta tenuta in freezer in gelato mantecato, senza aggiunta di altri ingredienti. Il gelato è stato proprio l’alimento che mi ha permesso di sopravvivere durante quel mese di agonia gastronomica. La mia zattera alimentare. Ogni mattina Claudia supervisionava la colazione a base di niente e frutta, poi mi consegnava una bottiglia, rigorosamente di vetro, contenente un succo di verdure varie e frutta fresca. La consistenza e il colore erano identici a quelli dello Slaim, la sostanza verde e appiccicosa con la quale giocavano i bambini negli anni Settanta. Il sapore, però, era assai peggiore. Ogni giorno ingurgitavo quella poltiglia che avrebbe depurato, rigenerato e donato energie nascoste ai miei piú che quarantennali organi. In effetti cominciai a sentirmi decisamente meglio. Almeno fino al mercoledí della seconda settimana. Quel giorno avevo dimenticato la bottiglia con lo strabiliante cocktail sul sedile di dietro della mia auto, posteggiata al sole.

The benefits of salicylic acid are another reason you should strive to choose organic produce. Because the plant uses the compound as a defense hormone, its concentration may be increased when that plant is bitten by bugs. Pesticide-laden plants aren’t nibbled as much and, perhaps as a result, appear to produce less salicylic acid. For example, in one study, soup made from organic vegetables was found to contain nearly six times more salicylic acid than soup prepared from conventional, nonorganically grown ingredients.78 Another way to get more salicylic acid bang for

Und die Gefühle haben einen Sinn. Freude erweckt die Lebensgeister. Wut bringt die Kraft, Unmögliches zu schaffen, und ist eine Faust aus Energie. Traurigkeit ist das Beste, wenn man einem Menschen begegnet. Alles wird Gänsehaut, der Moment zu Liebe und Geborgenheit. Angst ist für mich am Schwierigsten, weil sie uneindeutig ist. Aber das ist ihre Faszination. Sie muss uns beibringen, Stopp zu sagen. Uns beschützen. Und sie bringt uns bei, dass wir über unseren Schatten springen können. Dass wir Abenteuer erleben dürfen. Dass wir jemanden in der Kneipe ansprechen können, der oder die uns gefällt. Angst ist eine Spielwiese.

tomato juice could be thought of as relatively unprocessed because even much of the fiber is retained—unless salt is added, which would make it a processed food in my book and bump it right out of the green zone.

Studies show that if you drink a glass of water with three tablespoons of sugar (similar to what would be in a can of soda), you’ll have a big spike in your blood sugar levels within the first hour. That causes your body to release so much insulin to mop up the excess sugar that you actually overshoot and become hypoglycemic by the second hour, meaning that your blood sugar drops even lower than it would if you were fasting. Your body detects this low blood sugar, thinks you might be in some sort of famine situation, and responds by dumping fat into your bloodstream as an energy source to keep you alive.13 This excess fat in the blood can then go on to cause further problems.
