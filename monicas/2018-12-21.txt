Everything we want in life is squarely outside of our comfort zones—some closer, and some further outside. Growth, learning, and progress are outside. So are accomplishment, fulfillment, and satisfaction. They lie over the obstacles of fear, anxiety, and the unknown. The comfort zone for most people isn’t about comfort; it’s about retreating from fear and the fear of failure.

Dodson curve. This graph shows the relationship between a subject’s being “aroused” or stressed over a given task and their level of performance of the task. Perhaps unsurprisingly, low levels of arousal or pressure result in low performance levels. This makes some sense: if the tension of motivation is at a low point, one has no incentive to act. As stimulation kicks in and arousal levels increase, then the level of performance does as well—to a point. When tension levels get too high, perhaps because of anxiety or over-distraction, performance starts to decrease.

On the other hand, pushing too much also lessens one’s performance, as we move past mere arousal and into a frantic state. In this situation, we feel discouraged and distracted. Those feelings, in turn, open up the possibility of failure as a sort of relief—we just want to give up.

The middle ground, where aroused tension exists but is still manageable, is a space called “optimal anxiety”—just a small step outside the comfort zone. This is where performance is maximized by being just stressed enough to increase execution, but not so distressed that we can’t be productive. By pushing ourselves into that middle ground, we increase both the rate and quality of our accomplishments without overkill.

It’s still necessary to have a comfort zone. There’s nothing at all wrong with spending occasional time there, because we all need to relax and just “be” from time to time. That’s all well and good. You can’t jump into the deep end continually, day after day. Not only will you burn out quickly, but you’ll become discouraged because your feelings of progress will transform into fatigue and displeasure and turn everything into a chore. Just as the elite athlete must rest during training periods, so must you rest. Retreating into the comfort zone from time to time isn’t merely rest—it’s necessary recovery.

For example, an Internet blogger might earn a respectable income churning out simple, easily digested captions, quotes, and quick articles for a website. They may, however, have a desire to write something longer and more substantial, like a novel. But taking the time and making the effort to devote energy toward that novel could be complicated by several factors: self-doubt, feelings of unworthiness, a cramped schedule, or concerns about how much research they’ll need to do. To alleviate those fears, they simply stay in their workday rut where it’s safe and quiet. But by choosing to remain static in their comfort zone, they become dissatisfied and miserable, asking themselves “what if?” over and over.

Perfectionism is sometimes called “the highest form of self-abuse.” Striving for perfection is unreasonable almost by definition because it doesn’t even exist. Since perfection is almost never necessary in most situations—unless you’re a brain surgeon—it’s nothing more than an attempt to preserve one’s own self-worth.

We fear that without full and proper training, prep or awareness, our project will just collapse in a heap. But chances are remote of that fatality actually happening. What’s more conceivable is that you’ll feel more of a natural push or momentum to keep going when you do encounter occasional hiccups. You’ll be learning on the job as all of us had to do at some point or another.

Takeaways: Perfectionism isn’t just procrastination; perfectionism is a story you tell yourself to ensure that you never get launched. But let’s face the facts: your standards aren’t the issue. It’s your unwillingness to subject yourself to scrutiny from others.  Planning paralysis is when you become enamored with the preparation and planning as another form of procrastination that ultimately allows you to avoid action. It’s sneaky!  The 40–70 rule states that you should have no fewer than 40% of the necessary information yet no more than 70% before taking action or making a hard decision. This errs on the side of action but also ensures that you aren’t just shooting from the hip.  Action is preferred, but action is scary. Therefore, part of the assurance you can make to yourself in taking action is to actively think about the costs for backing out and reversing decisions.

what we fear about hard situations is their uncertainty. So exposing yourself to the tough elements will result in your knowing what you’re in for. It might even turn out to be less terrible than you thought it’d be. You realize things are not as bad as you have built them up to be, and discomfort is usually fleeting and an unworthy obstacle.
